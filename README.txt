Biome Height Tweaker

------

Biome Height Tweaker is a small Mienecraft mod to change the Base Height and Height Variation of the biomes in game.

This can be done by either setting the numbers in the auto generated configuration file (generates on first run to the default height settings).  Or by using the in game slider bars under the mod configuration page.

The 1.9 (and presumably future versions) is only needed on the machine generating the world.  (ie server for multiplayer, client for single player)  Thus this can be a server side only mod.  In addition forge incompatibilities aside the mod is configured to work with a unmodified client,  thus hopefully may be used along side forge sponge.

Building from source:

In most cases you will need the eclipse folder from the forge MDK and copy it into the root of this project, then usual Forge MDK gradle commands can be used to set up your environment to build the mod for yourself.  (If you do not wish to use the eclipse IDE you can skip copying in its metadata)

More information in the README-MDK about building this and other forge mods.
